UPDATE: Full source released for everyone - Dont try other peoples versions that steal ect

uses blocksmith library to generate random btc address and pk then checks addys.txt for a match, if one is found you get green highlighted message and txt file created with the result



cd to script root

pip install blocksmith
pip install ecdsa
pip install base58

python main.py 
or 
double click main.py file

will run on all available cores

add any of your addresses to Addys.txt

if hit is found you will have new txt file in script root


if you make your own version give credit for the base, much love

Good Luck, if you get lucky im for hire ;)
