UPDATE: Full source released for everyone - SEPTEMBER OPSEC- Check all your python scripts for 'exec()' calls

uses blocksmith library to generate random btc address and pk then checks addys.txt for a match, if one is found you get txt file created with the result in script root

edit: prev upload had colorama but have removed this so the script is as untouched as possible for a base

cd to script root

pip install blocksmith
pip install ecdsa
pip install base58

python main.py 
or 
double click main.py file

will run on all available cores

add any of your addresses to Addys.txt

if hit is found you will have new txt file in script root


if you make your own version give credit for the base, much love

Good Luck, if you get lucky im for hire ;)
